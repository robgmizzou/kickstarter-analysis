# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

<p> Purpose of this project is to provide Louise analysis of similar projects on Kickstarter with respect to launch dates and funding goals.  This analysis provides visual and written findings outlining outcomes based on campaign launch timing and campaign funding goals.<p/>

## Analysis and Challenges

<p> Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was performed by filtering and isolating relevant campaign data.  After removing all datapoints not related to the subcategory "Theater", the results were categorized by month based on launch date.  From that dataset, we remove "live" campaigns, and grouped the remaining campaigns based on their funding status: "Successful", "Failed" or "Canceled".  Visualized as a line graph, this demonstrates the seasonaility of Kickstarter campaigns similar to Louise's based on start date.<p/>

<p> Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals looks at the same subset of "Theater" campaigns and categorizes the campagins based on total funding levels, using primarily $5,000 tranches up to $50,000.  All items below $1,000 and $50,000 were their own categories.<p/>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

<p> May is the most successful start date in terms of total successful campaigns as well as the proportion of launched campaigns meeting their funding goals.  April and June are also favorable times to launch a campaign, with December being the least successful in terms of total successful projects launched and the percentage of launched campaigns meeting the funding goal.<p/>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

<p> This analysis shows the percentages of successful campaigns based on goal levels.  Visualized as a line graph, this chart demonstrates successful campaigns usually goal less than $20,000.  Goals over $20,000 have historically failed more than succeed.  The highest volume of successful campaigns goal less than $10,000, whith campaigns with goals of $5,000 completing successfully over 73% of the time.<p/>
Projects between $35,000 and $44,999 have successfully been funded 66% of the time, but based on 6 successes and only 9 total projects in this subset of the data, this         would be difficult data to form a firm conclusion against.<p/>


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
<p> Due to the methodology of this analysis, certain qualitative components are not captured in this breakdown of campaigns.  This dataset shows nothing of the "qualtity" of the listings or how much marketing and promotion was around the campaign supporting these productions.<p/>

<p>Within the available data, driving down to analyse the total funded against goal on successful campaigns would demonstrate how to set a stretch goal, and would Louise how to position her next project in a more cometitive manner. Numerous projects funded beyond 100% of goal, showing potentially to better position a baseline goal (required funding), and show a stretch goal to potentially include enhancements and production quality improvements.<p/>

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?<p/>
  <p>May is the best time to launch a campaign, followed by April and June.<br>  
  <p>December launches produce the fewest successful campaigns in terms of total campaigns successful and percentage of successful projects.<p/>
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  <p>Goals over $20,000 have historically failed more than succeeded.  The highest volume of successful campaigns had a goal of less than $10,000, with campaigns with goals of     $5,000 completing successfully over 73% of the time.<p/>
- What are some limitations of this dataset?<p/>
  <p>Despite the large dataset, there are not a huge amount of campaigns that are good comparisons to Louise's project.  As the platform matures, the number of comparable         campaigns will also grow.  Kickstarter is not the only manner of funding a production, so this can be taken as only an indicator of how plays on Kickstarter perform.<p/>
  <p>Kickstarter data also excludes the level of effort promoting and marketing the campaign.  The impact on the campaign's success is likely to be extremely correlated to the     effort to bring awareness to the campaign.<p/>
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<p/>
  <p>Creating a table overlapping the two analyses here may provide some additional insight into the timing of project with similar funding goals to Louise.  If she were           interested in another project, we could add a filer to the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date to look only at the projects in her potential funding range, although this       would risk selecting a very thin set of campaigns, risking the integrity of the analysis.<p/>
